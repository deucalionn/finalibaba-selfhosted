# Roadmap — Finalibaba Self-Hosted

Current stable release: **v1.1.0**

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Minor versions (1.x) are additive and backwards-compatible. v2.0 is a breaking architectural change (multi-user).

---

## v1.1.0 — Released ✓

- [x] **English & French UI** — `next-intl` integration, language auto-detected from browser (`Accept-Language`), manual switcher in Settings. No URL prefix per locale.
- [x] **User-configurable tax rates** — PEA, CTO, and Crypto rates editable in Settings.
- [x] **Mobile UX improvements** — WCAG-compliant touch targets (44×44px), responsive header layouts, icon-only buttons on narrow viewports.
- [x] **Auto-sync on app open** — sync triggered automatically when opening the app (all sources: LCL, Trade Republic, Woob institutions). Badge shown during sync.

---

## v1.2 — Data import & resilience

*The most-requested gap vs alternatives: getting data in without auto-sync, and keeping it safe.*

- [ ] **CSV import** — bulk import of transactions and balance history for accounts not covered by auto-sync
- [ ] **Historical net worth import** — import past balance snapshots (CSV/spreadsheet) to backfill the historical chart for users migrating from Excel or Finary
- [ ] **Backup & restore** — one-command database export and full restore; critical for self-hosters before upgrades

---

## v1.3 — Budgeting & cash-flow

*The main gap vs Firefly III: spending visibility and forward projection.*

- [ ] **Transaction categories & budgets** — categorize transactions (food, transport, housing…), set monthly budget envelopes per category, track spending vs budget
- [ ] **Recurring transactions** — flag subscriptions and regular income; project future cash flow and detect missed payments

---

## v1.4 — Advanced analytics & international fiscal support

*Power features for investors, and making the tax layer work correctly regardless of where you live.*

- [ ] **Benchmark comparison** — overlay portfolio CAGR against a reference index (MSCI World, S&P 500, CAC 40)
- [ ] **Portfolio rebalancing** — define a target allocation per account, show current drift, suggest trades to rebalance
- [ ] **Interest & dividend income tracking** — record interest earned on savings accounts (taxable or exempt) and dividends received on investment accounts as discrete income events, separate from balance snapshots; display as income in analytics
- [ ] **Flexible account tax treatment** — each investment account gets a user-defined tax status (tax-exempt like PEA/ISA/Roth IRA, tax-deferred like PER/401k, or fully taxable); latent tax calculation uses the account's own status instead of a global type — makes the app correct for non-French users who have no PEA equivalent
- [ ] **Annual tax report** — yearly fiscal summary: realised gains, dividend income, taxable events; designed to be country-agnostic (exportable data) with a French IFU-ready view as a first implementation
- [ ] **Multi-currency** — hold positions in USD, GBP, CHF and display everything converted to the reference currency (EUR)

---

## v1.5 — Security & sharing

*Hardening the built-in auth and enabling controlled access for advisors or family.*

- [ ] **2FA (TOTP)** — two-factor authentication for the built-in credentials provider (`AUTH_ENABLED=true`)
- [ ] **Read-only share link** — generate a token-protected view-only URL to share the dashboard with an advisor or spouse without giving write access
- [ ] **Alerts & webhooks** — notify via Telegram, ntfy, or email when net worth crosses a threshold, a loan is nearly paid off, or a sync fails

---

## v1.6 — Integrations & platform

*Broader bank coverage, automation hooks, and better mobile experience.*

- [ ] **More broker integrations** — Degiro, Interactive Brokers, Boursorama, Binance via Woob or direct API (demand-driven)
- [ ] **GoCardless webhooks** — real-time balance updates instead of polling every 4 hours
- [ ] **Public REST API** — read-only API endpoints for external tools (Home Assistant, custom dashboards, mobile widgets)
- [ ] **PWA / mobile-optimised** — installable progressive web app with swipe-friendly views for phones
- [ ] **Light theme** — optional light colour scheme (currently dark only)
- [ ] **Plaid integration** — US and Canadian banks (only if there is clear community demand)

---

## v2.0 — Multi-user

*Breaking architectural change: all data gains user ownership, requiring a migration.*

- [ ] **Multi-user support** — independent portfolios for multiple users on the same instance; role-based access (owner / read-only guest)
