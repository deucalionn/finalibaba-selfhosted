## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LoicSERRE/finalibaba-selfhosted
cd finalibaba-selfhosted
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — at minimum set:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=        # strong random password
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=          # openssl rand -base64 32
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec app npx prisma db seed  # optional — pre-populates common banks
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). First boot takes a few minutes while the image builds.

## Account types

All types can be added and updated manually from the UI. Auto-sync is optional.

| Type | Description | Auto-sync |
|---|---|---|
| Checking / Savings | Bank accounts with balance history | Woob (FR banks) |
| Investment — PEA / CTO | Stock and ETF portfolios with live prices | Trade Republic |
| Crypto | Cryptocurrency wallets with live prices | Trade Republic |
| Real estate | Property with optional mortgage liability | — |
| Automobile | Vehicle with purchase price | — |
| Loan | Amortising loan with auto-computed remaining capital | — |
| Meal vouchers | Ticket Restaurant and similar | — |

## Automatic sync (optional)

All sync modules are **optional** — the app works fully without them. Leave credentials blank to disable a module.

### Trade Republic

Available in 18 EU countries: AT, BE, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, IE, IT, LT, LU, LV, NL, PL, PT, SI, SK.

Set `TR_PHONE` and `TR_PIN` in `.env`. First-time setup (interactive, required once):

```bash
docker compose exec -it sync python setup_tr.py
# Approve the notification in the TR app, then enter the 4-digit code
```

The session persists in a Docker volume. Renew it when it expires (every few weeks).

### French banks via Woob

Configure credentials per institution directly from **Settings → Institutions**. Supports any bank available in the [Woob](https://woob.tech) ecosystem.

---

## CSV import

For checking/savings/meal-voucher accounts not covered by auto-sync (foreign banks, cash accounts, migrating from Excel or Finary…), open the account and use one of the two import buttons. Both preview rows before import — likely duplicates are flagged and unchecked by default, but you can still select them.

**Import transactions** — columns `date`, `label` (or `libellé`/`description`), `amount` (or `montant`). Amount positive = credit, negative = debit. Flags a row as a likely duplicate when its date, label, and amount all match an existing transaction.

**Import balance history** — columns `date`, `balance` (or `solde`/`montant`/`valeur`). One point per date; this backfills both the account's balance chart and the dashboard's net worth history. Flags a row as a likely duplicate when a balance is already recorded for that date.

Both accept dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` or `DD/MM/YYYY`.

## Securing access

By default the app is open — intended for local networks, VPNs, or a reverse proxy that handles authentication.

### Built-in password

```env
AUTH_ENABLED=true
AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password
```

For better security, use a bcrypt hash instead of a plaintext password:

```bash
# Generate a hash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" your_password | tr -d ':\n'
```

```env
AUTH_ENABLED=true
AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH=<generated hash>
```

### Reverse proxy (recommended for internet-facing installs)

Any of these work out of the box:

- **Nginx Proxy Manager** — Basic Auth tab
- **Caddy** — `basicauth` directive
- **Traefik + Authelia / Authentik** — full SSO
- **Cloudflare Access** — zero-trust, free up to 50 users

### VPN (simplest)

Use **Tailscale**, WireGuard, or OpenVPN — no auth config needed.

## Updating

```bash
# Pull pre-built images (recommended)
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

# Or rebuild from source
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

Migrations are applied automatically on startup.

---

## Backup & restore

Two equivalent ways to back up your data — a full `pg_dump` of the database, so schema and data always stay consistent.

**From the UI:** Settings → Backup & restore → *Download a backup* / *Restore*. Restoring is destructive and requires confirmation.

**From the command line** (scriptable, good for cron):

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh                          # writes backups/finalibaba_<timestamp>.sql.gz
./scripts/restore.sh backups/finalibaba_20260713_120000.sql.gz
```

`restore.sh` asks for confirmation before replacing all current data, and briefly stops the `app`/`sync` containers during the restore so nothing writes concurrently. Do this before every upgrade.
